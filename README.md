# 🛡️ Honeypot Project

## 📌 What Is a Honeypot?

A **honeypot** is a decoy system used in cybersecurity to attract potential attackers. Its primary purpose is **observation**—to monitor malicious behavior and understand attacker techniques without risking real assets.

> 🔍 Honeypots help capture insights such as:
>
> * Commands executed by attackers
> * Exploits they attempt to use
> * Files uploaded or downloaded

By simulating a vulnerable system, honeypots act as bait, providing security professionals with valuable intelligence.

## 🤖 How Do Attackers Interact With It?

* Simulates real-world behavior: accepts common shell commands like `ls`, `cat`, etc.
* Emulates services such as **SSH**, **Telnet**, and **HTTP**
* Displays a fake system banner:
  `Linux version 5.4.0 (mocked kernel version)`

This realistic behavior increases the likelihood of interaction from malicious actors, helping to gather meaningful data.

## 🛠️ Project Structure and Development Steps

### 1️⃣ Logger System

#### 🔐 What Do We Log?

* IP addresses of attackers
* Attempted usernames and passwords
* Uploaded files or download attempts
* Executed commands

#### 📁 Where Is It Logged?

* General SSH activity: `ssh_server.log`
* Credential attempts (bots): `creds_ssh_server.log`

#### 🎯 Why Logging Matters

* Helps **identify tools, scripts, or techniques** used by attackers
* Reveals **intentions and patterns**
* Enables security research and forensics

Logging is the **first component** to be implemented in any honeypot, as it's the core for data collection and analysis.

## 🎯 Project Scope

This project includes:

* 🧷 **SSH Honeypot**: Mimics a vulnerable SSH service with fake responses.
* 🌐 **HTML Honeypot**: A mock web interface designed to lure HTTP-based attacks.

Future improvements may include adding alert systems, real-time dashboards, or integration with threat intelligence platforms.
